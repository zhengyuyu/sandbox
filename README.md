sandbox
=======

assignment #1

This is a sandbox based on Python. 

To build a sandbox, import this sandbox module or execute it in interpreter mode, then create a new instance of sandbox,



a = sandbox(<timeout>),



the <timeout> parameter is the max execution time in second of every function in sandbox.





To run code in sandbox, after successfully create a sandbox instance, use,



a.run(func,*arg, **kw)



All code have to be wraped in the fuction.







To run the example programs, execute directly in command line.
